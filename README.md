# Image Pixel Manipulation with Python

This repository contains Python code for manipulating pixels in images, altering their visual characteristics or content programmatically.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to perform pixel manipulation on images using Python. Pixel manipulation can involve various operations such as changing colors, applying filters, enhancing details, or even generating artistic effects.

## Features

- **Pixel-level manipulation:** Perform operations on individual pixels of an image.
- **Color transformations:** Alter the colors of an image through various transformations.
- **Filtering and effects:** Apply filters and effects to enhance or modify images.
- **Basic image processing:** Implement fundamental image processing techniques using Python.
